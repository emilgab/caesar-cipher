# Caesar cipher
As part of the OsloMet course: "Problem-Solving with Scripting"

## What is a Caesar Cipher?
A caesar cipher decodes a word by replacing each letter with a fixed number position somewhere down the alphabet.
For example, with a letter shift of 6, the letter A would be replaced by the letter G.
